== Z#KIYOB ~I do not know what the point of its existence is, but I guess I have to believe it carries a reward all on its own.~
= ~I don't believe in faith, but in retrospect, I must have believed in this inner law for a long, long time now. It does brings me a kind of odd willingness to perish for it. Impractical, inconvenient, foolish, yet I do not seem to truly mind.~

= ~So as I was saying, Kavo married a beautiful female girl called Yoneki. The funny thing was, they both went around telling each other how much they hated each other on the wedding day. I was invited and they were standing on opposite sides of the big door. They did everything separately, to show how much they hated each other.~
== Z#KIYOB ~If they hated each other so much, why did they get married?~
== BJAN ~Kavo told all of us it had something do with too many overdue turnip taxes, so they wanted to combine accounts or something. I thought they had a pretty way of consolidating the tax accounts, then the courts wouldn't be able to pin nothing on them. I understand Yoneki said the same.~
== Z#KIYOB ~Jan, you are really starting to get on my nerves.~
== BJAN ~All through the wedding, Yoneki's family and friends weren't allowed to talk to Kavo's family and friends, and nor were his family and friends allowed to talk to hers. Meantime, both of them refused to look at each other, and when they took the vow they had the priest stand between them so that they wouldn't have to see each other. Never heard them say a word through the whole thing, probably bribed the priest to pretend he had heard a yes from both parties to get things moving. And as soon as the ceremony was over they both hurried away to attend to each their own business without so much as noticing each other. But you know what I found really interesting?~
== Z#KIYOB ~This is not funny, Jan.~
== BJAN ~Yes, it is really a very very tragic tale. You see they were so terribly terribly in love, head over heels in fact. So, why would they say they hated each other, and not even stay in the same house, or speak a word to each other?~

== Z#KOVAB ~Jan, I do not find this amusing.~
== BJAN ~Yes, it's a really tragic tale. Didn't she tell you? But anyway, so they had to both go out for lunch together one day, finally, but they both refused to bring out their best turnips, yet both of them would not eat any turnips which were not the best turnips around.~
== Z#KOVAB ~Oh yes. I suppose they're all turnip merchants, yes. What a delightful occupation.~
== BJAN ~I'm glad you approve. Unfortunately they weren't happy about that, and so they decided, rather than quarrel with each other, since they really, deep down inside, if not for the turnips, loved each other so dreadfully dreadfully much...~
== Z#KOVAB ~Jan...~
== BJAN ~Hmm, you need a recap? Well, as I told your girl, but I guess she didn't tell you, Kavo and Yoneki were so dreadfully terribly absolutely in love with each other, except for the turnips, that they really didn't want to fight with each other, so they decided to have a competition to see who was better. They would both sit down facing each other, and the first person to talk or whose stomach asked for turnips would be the one who would have to provide the turnips for the meal.~
= ~So they sat and waited, and waited for so long, that what do you know, turnip thieves would come! And Kavo, he saw some thieves going for her turnips behind her back, so he got up quietly and went to protect her turnips. And Yoneki, she saw some other thieves going for his turnips behind his back, so she got up quietly and went to protect his turnips. Because all their turnips were among the best, and they both did it for the love of each other and for the love of the finest, truest turnips.~
== Z#KOVAB ~I don't see what's so tragic about that.~
== BJAN ~Oh, but they were both found dead the next morning and all their turnips were gone. Isn't it a tremendous tragedy? If only it were just a story, I would not have wanted to give such an upsetting ending. I think together they could have beaten off one band of thieves, then the other, but because they each tried to defend turnips separately, they were overpowered.~
== Z#KOVAB ~I know I really shouldn't be asking this, so what's the lesson?~
== BJAN ~Never ever stay silent when protecting turnips. It may cost you a turnip or two more, but at least you won't lose all your turnips.~
== Z#KOVAB ~I might have guessed. Very well done, Jan. Now if you'll excuse me, I have less important things to do than to listen to your life changing, insightful stories into the nature of gnomekind.~

== Z#KIYOB ~Indeed.~
== BNALIA ~Well if I can help someone the person has to be lesser than me for me to be able to help him.~
== Z#KIYOB ~<CHARNAME> could have helped you, but that didn't make <PRO_HIMHER> any more or less than you.~
